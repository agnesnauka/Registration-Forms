# Registration-Forms
Project overview

General project description

We have a simple project with 2 similar registration forms (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stack is used).

We have a Web page that consists of 2 different registration forms. Registration forms allow people to enter their data for registering them as users on the Web page.

The registration forms are partially covered by the automation tests, which ensure that forms are working and all workflows and elements on the forms are working, though some parts are not tested at all.
Also, some parts of the automated tests for the second form intentionally contain some bugs, so automated tests are not working properly and need to be fixed.
